1. Imagine the listener's music vibe as a blend of emotions and energies extracted from their top 100 songs in 2018.
The audio aura captures the overall mood, tempo, and feel of their music taste during that specific time frame.
It's like creating a musical snapshot that reflects the essence of their favorite tunes from that year.

2. Think of it like this: the calculated audio vibe might not totally capture the listener's true music taste.
Why? Well, the top 100 list might miss out on their absolute favorites, and the snapshot from 2018 might not show how their taste changed.
A better way? Give more weight to songs they really love, consider how their music taste evolves over time, and look at genres and moods.
It's like getting a more accurate picture of their musical vibe by paying attention to the details.
